Support in Linux for DavinciResolve with AMD gpu's

Davinci Resolve only supports NVIDIA CUDA GPU's out the box, for AMD gpu's you are either required to install the AMDGPU-PRO drivers, or use ROCM instead.

Those packages are supposed to grab the supported rocm repository, add yourself to the video group and installs the required udev rules

# Warning - Highly experimental packages, use those at your own risks. 

Read the Wiki instead to know how it's done.
